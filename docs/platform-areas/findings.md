# Findings

Findings centralizes investigation work across QuilrAI. It brings together findings from browser,
endpoint, gateway, compliance, identity, and all-source views so teams can triage risk without
switching tools.

## When To Use It

Use Findings to investigate security, privacy, compliance, or operational issues detected by the
platform. It is the main place to move from summary signals into detailed evidence.

## Finding Views

- **Finding Insights:** Summary view for high-level investigation trends.
- **All Findings:** Cross-source finding stream.
- **Browser Extension Findings:** Findings from browser extension activity.
- **Endpoint Agent Findings:** Findings from endpoint agent telemetry, when endpoint is enabled.
- **LLM Gateway Findings:** Findings from protected LLM Gateway traffic.
- **MCP Gateway Findings:** Findings from protected MCP Gateway traffic.
- **Compliance Findings:** Findings and no-risk interactions from compliance integrations such as
  Claude Compliance and OpenAI Compliance, when configured.
- **Identity Findings:** Status and identity-related findings.

## Key Capabilities

- Filter findings by application, user, finding type, source, category, and other dimensions.
- Drill into finding details and supporting context.
- Navigate from app, user, and account pages into filtered finding views.
- Review LLM Gateway findings from a logs-backed V2 view when enabled.
- Review Compliance Findings by provider, detection scope, user, category, and subcategory.
- Open related conversations or interaction details from finding rows where available.

## Finding Insights Time Ranges

Finding Insights supports preset and custom time ranges. Preset behavior:

- **24h** – rolling window ending at the current time.
- **3 days / 7 days / 30 days** – range ends at the close of today; the start is aligned to the
  opening of the appropriate number of calendar days in the past, so the window covers complete
  days.
- **3 months / 6 months / 1 year** – range ends at the close of today; the start is aligned to the
  first day of the month the appropriate number of calendar months in the past.

When clicking a data point on a Finding Insights chart to drill into a specific period, the platform
selects a time window based on the active preset's granularity:

- Within-day views: one hour from the selected point.
- Ranges up to 30 days: the full calendar day of the selected point.
- Ranges longer than 30 days: the full calendar month of the selected point.

## Main Workflows

1. Start in Finding Insights to understand current risk themes.
2. Move to All Findings or a source-specific finding tab.
3. Filter by app, user, category, or finding type.
4. Open details to review evidence.
5. Decide whether to update controls, detection models, gateway settings, or user coaching.

## Gateway And Compliance Findings

LLM Gateway Findings can use a logs-backed V2 view for gateway traffic. The V2 view supports app,
user, start-date, action, category, and subcategory filters, with a details drawer for request and
response evidence.

Compliance Findings provides a provider switcher for supported compliance sources. Claude and
OpenAI views share the same investigation pattern: select provider scope, choose findings-only,
no-risk, or all-interaction coverage, filter by user and DLP category, and open the details drawer
to inspect the source and content evidence.

## Access Requirements

Access to the Findings section and its individual tabs is controlled by role-based permissions.
Each tab — Finding Insights, All Findings, Browser Extension, Endpoint Agent, LLM Gateway,
Compliance, MCP Gateway, and Identity — requires READ permission for its corresponding
FINDING sub-resource. Users see only the tabs their assigned role grants access to, and the
Findings sidebar link automatically navigates to the first tab the user can reach.

Endpoint Agent findings are additionally shown only when the endpoint agent capability is
enabled for the tenant. Compliance findings depend on configured compliance integrations and
the related Compliance permissions.
