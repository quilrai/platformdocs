# Integrations

Integrations connect QuilrAI to the systems that provide identity, device, SaaS, cloud, and AI
signals. They are the setup and lifecycle surface for connectors and connector instances.

## When To Use It

Use Integrations when you need to:

- Connect QuilrAI to an external system.
- Review existing connected integrations.
- Browse available integrations.
- Configure or update an integration instance.
- Follow setup guidance for supported connectors.
- Manage integration-specific OAuth or configuration flows.

## Key Capabilities

- Connected integrations view.
- Available integrations catalog.
- Search and filter connectors.
- Configure new instances.
- Edit existing instances when permitted.
- Connector-specific setup documentation, including required scopes, permissions, and configuration.
- Separate advanced routes for OAuth, token flow, MCP clients, MCP servers, and tool policies where
  enabled.

## Integration Catalog

Connectors are organized into the following categories:

- **Data Forwarding:** [Webhook](./data-forwarding/webhook.md), [Syslog](./data-forwarding/syslog.md), [Syslog Audit](./data-forwarding/syslog-audit.md), [Email](./data-forwarding/email.md).

## Main Workflows

1. Open Integrations.
2. Review Connected integrations or browse Available integrations.
3. Search or filter by connector category.
4. Select a connector.
5. Follow configuration guidance and complete required scopes or credentials.
6. Return to Connected integrations to monitor or update the instance.

## Advanced Integration Areas

Some integration routes are specialized operational areas and may not be visible to every customer:

- OAuth integration configuration.
- Token flow configuration.
- MCP clients and MCP servers.
- Tool policies for MCP or AI tool governance.
- OAuth and token-flow routes that support connector authorization and callback workflows.
